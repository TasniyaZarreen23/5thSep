   <h3 style="color: rgb(111, 25, 39) ;" align="center">"The character of the teacher in life is very special, they are like background music in someone’s life, whose presence is not seen on stage, but its presence brings life to the drama. Similarly, a teacher also has a role in our life. Everyone needs a teacher, no matter where you are in your life. In India, 5 September is observed as Teachers’ Day, which is celebrated by Drs. Sarvepalli is Radhakrishnan’s birthday. He was the first Vice President of India and the second President who was a teacher before taking up these posts."
